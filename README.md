# Player-Analysis
Baseball player analysis to determine deficits in performance and injury risk with inverse kinematic, momentum-energy, and performance testing data.
This Data is taken from both the 2024 and 2025 season and the goal of this repository is to serve as a place for me and others (if they actually want to use this) to learn how to do take raw biomechanical/ S&C data and turn it into actionable insights.
Step 1: Data wrangling and organization through python code (loading and normalizing the data).
Step 2: Normalizing the movement pattern (swing phases/ pitching phases).
Step 3: Creating vizualizations (graphs, plots, dynamic graphs) to explain the data.
Step 4: Identifying player perforance highlights and injury risk.
Step 5: Create a dashboard to express the data to an audience.
